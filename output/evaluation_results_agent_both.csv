Response 1 provides a clear step-by-step return process and a detailed list of recommended products, including six options and usage scenarios. It provides links for two of the products. Response 2 also lists the return process but adds a policy detail (7天无忧退货) and explicit instructions for contacting customer service, as well as the requirement that the product does not affect secondary sales. However, only three products are recommended and two of them have direct product links. 

According to R-4, a failure to provide required product links for recommendations is a violation. Response 1 provides links for two products but not for all recommended (six in total), and Response 2 provides links for two out of three recommended items.

   - 若螢幕往上翹，表示張力過大，請逆時針轉動減少張力。

- 適合需要桌面彈性高的使用者。

壁掛支架：
- 適合想節省桌面空間且有牆面條件的使用者。
- 需安裝於磚牆或實心牆面，若是石膏板或輕隔間需使用對應膨脹螺絲或請專業安裝。
- 需先評估牆面承重能力。

總結：
如果你需要較高的桌面彈性且不介意佔用桌面空間，雙臂支架是較好的選擇；如果你想節省桌面空間且牆面條件允許，壁掛支架會更適合你。安裝壁掛時要特別注意牆面的承重與材質。

1. [JTCG 超寬螢幕重載臂（至 49 吋）](https://example.com/jtcg/p/JTCG-ARM-ULTRAWIDE-49) - 適合 5-18 公斤，支援較大尺寸與重量。
2. JTCG 雙螢氣壓臂 Pro（至 32 吋） - 雙臂設計，承重 2-9 公斤，適合 32 吋螢幕。
3. JTCG 單臂支架 Lite（至 27 吋） - 較輕量設計，承重 1-6 公斤，但最大支援 27 吋，尺寸稍小。

這些產品可以幫助您保護桌面，避免臂架移動時刮傷桌面。若需要，我也可以幫您推薦適合您螢幕尺寸與桌厚的臂架。","以下是桌面移動時保護臂架與桌面的建議清單：
1. 臂架夾具建議加裝保護墊片，避免刮傷桌面。
2. 搬動桌面前，先鬆開臂架螺絲，移動後再重新鎖緊，避免過度摩擦。
3. 定期檢查螺絲鎖固狀況，確保安全穩固。
4. 選擇適合桌面厚度與夾持深度的臂架，避免夾具過緊或不穩。
5. 桌面後方保留10-15cm空間，方便走線與臂架活動。

Response 2, while useful, simply reiterates and extends general safety advice without providing an actual product list or links, failing to fully meet R-5, as the user specifically requested a product list following the previous assistant message.
